# Prefetch
Windows Prefetch parser. Supports all known versions from Windows XP to Windows 10.

I still have to clean up some code, refactor a bit, and add properties for things like trace chains and file metrics collections, but everything else is functional.

Many more unit tests will also be added soon

# TODO
- Split out Win8x into Win80 and Win81 for test cases
