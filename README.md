# Prefetch
Windows Prefetch parser. Supports all known versions from Windows XP to Windows 10.

#NOTE
You need to run this code on at least Windows 8 in order for the decompression of Windows 10 prefetch files to work. I still have to some testing on failing gracefully if run on < Windows 8 if Windows 10 prefetch (version 30) files are found.

# TODO
- Split out Win8x into Win80 and Win81 for test cases
